# FFTextWrap
Personal project for adding textwrap to Fennec Firefox (Firefox on Android). Compared to other text wrap/reflow add-ons on AMO, this reflows the entire page based on touch events - the page will reflow as soon as you finish your pinch to zoom! No more clicking on text elements! Source code at: https://github.com/siyangqiu/FFTextWrap
